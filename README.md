## ðŸ’¿ What is This?

Starlightz is a fully static, JSON-powered media interface that runs directly in Media Station X.  
It looks like a streaming app, but it's really just some spicy HTML, CSS, and JSON magic hosted on GitHub.

You can stream:

- ðŸŽ¬ Videos & clips from the lists
- ðŸŽ‰ Meme clips, local content, or anything that MSX supports

- - -

## ðŸ’– Why?

Because itâ€™s fun.  
Because MSX is underrated.  
Because you can literally make your own Netflix with just a GitHub repo and 10 braincells.
